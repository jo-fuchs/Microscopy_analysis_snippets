# Microscopy analysis snippets
Some code snippets I often use in ImageJ macros

ImageJ Snippets:
[x] Max_project images.ijm: Batch version for z-projecting Confocal images
[x] Nd2-to-8bit-tif.ijm: Batch version for changing Image Type (e.g. pre NeuronJ)
[x] Intensity_measurements.ijm: Batch version for measuring intensity of whole with semi-automatic thresholded selection
[ ] ROI-manager loops
[ ] Selection refinements in masks
[ ] Line profiles


R:
[x] Randomize_folder.R: copies and renames files in a folder & creates a lookup table for unblinding
